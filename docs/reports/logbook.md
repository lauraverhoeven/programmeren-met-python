**RQ1: How has the total avoided use of fossil energy due to wind power, changed over the period 2010-2018? 
What part of this avoided use of fossil energy can be assigned to wind power on land and to wind power at sea?** Possible methods: bar graphs per year (2010-2018) of the total avoided use of fossil energy due to wind power with the years on the x-axis, 
and the total avoided use of fossil energy on the y-axis, with different colors to highlight the assignment to wind power on land and to wind power at sea per year (i.e. on the bars).
