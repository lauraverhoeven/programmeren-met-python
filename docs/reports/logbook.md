**RQ1: How has the total avoided use of fossil energy due to wind power, changed over the period 2010-2018? 
What part of this avoided use of fossil energy can be assigned to wind power on land and to wind power at sea?** 
Possible methods: bar graphs per year (2010-2018) of the total avoided use of fossil energy due to wind power with the years on the x-axis, 
and the total avoided use of fossil energy on the y-axis, with different colors to highlight the assignment to wind power on land and to wind power at sea per year (i.e. on the bars).

**RQ2: How much has the CO2 emission in the Netherlands changed in the period of 1990 to 2018 and which renewable energy source has relatively reduced CO2 emission the most?** 
Possible methods: a line chart showing the CO2 emission, with the years 1990-2018 on the x-axis and CO2 emission on the y-axis. For the second part of the research question:
a bar graph with a bar for each renewable energy source per year (1990-2018) on the x-axis, with relative reduced CO2 emission on the y-axis.
