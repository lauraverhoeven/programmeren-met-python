#choice of data set and describing data
We have chosen to use the data set "Hernieuwbare energie; verbruik naar energiebron, techniek en toepassing" (renewable energy per energysource, technology and application, available at: https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/portal.html?_la=nl&_catalog=CBS&tableId=83109NED&_theme=126)
for our research project. This data set includes information about use of renewable energy sources (wind-, water-, solarpower, geothermal energy, aerothermic energy and biomass),
including information about the avoided use of fossil energy and avoided CO2 emissions per renewable energy source. 
We are intereseted in this data set, because renewable energy is a very relevant topic with a huge impact on our generation. 
We are very curious to see how renewable energy is used in the Netherlands and how its use and impact has changed in our lifetimes.
We think this is a topic which statistics should be more widely known and we think it would be good if the data is more easily accesible.
Thus, using this research project, we would like to create some insight in the use of renewable energy in the Netherlands for anyone interested in this topic.



# Research questions

**RQ1: How has the total avoided use of fossil energy due to wind power, changed over the period 2010-2018? 
What part of this avoided use of fossil energy can be assigned to wind power on land and to wind power at sea?** 
Possible methods: bar graphs per year (2010-2018) of the total avoided use of fossil energy due to wind power with the years on the x-axis, 
and the total avoided use of fossil energy on the y-axis, with different colors to highlight the assignment to wind power on land and to wind power at sea per year (i.e. on the bars).

**RQ2: How much has the CO2 emission in the Netherlands changed in the period of 1990 to 2018 and which renewable energy source has relatively reduced CO2 emission the most?** 
Possible methods: a line chart showing the CO2 emission, with the years 1990-2018 on the x-axis and CO2 emission on the y-axis. For the second part of the research question:
a bar graph with a bar for each renewable energy source per year (1990-2018) on the x-axis, with relative reduced CO2 emission on the y-axis.
